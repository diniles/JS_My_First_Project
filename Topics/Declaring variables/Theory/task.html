<h2>Declaring variables</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>In JavaScript, there are data types with unchangeable values. However, when working with large-scale programs, storing data and intermediate calculation results is often necessary. To accomplish this, variables are used.</p><h5 id="what-is-a-variable">What is a variable?</h5><p>A<strong> variable </strong>is a special place in memory where you can store data to access it later. It's like a box with a gift inside, which is also a variable!</p><p>Every variable has a <strong>name</strong> to distinguish it from other variables. It is possible to access a value by its variable name. </p><p>Variables are one of the most often utilized elements of programs, so it is vital to understand and use them well.</p><h5 id="how-to-declare-a-variable">How to declare a variable?</h5><p>Before you start working with a variable, you need to <strong>declare</strong> (in other words,<strong> </strong>create) it. JavaScript uses two keywords to create variables:</p><ul><li><p><code class="language-javascript">let</code> defines a <strong>mutable </strong>variable, the value of which<em> </em>can be changed;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-javascript">const</code> declares a<strong> constant</strong> variable whose value you want to forbid overwriting.</p></li></ul><p>To declare a variable, you must name it using one of the predefined keywords. It is good practice to assign a variable name that describes its contents. Always try to choose meaningful and readable names for variables to make your code easy to understand. </p><h5 id="mutable-variables">Mutable variables</h5><p>Let's try to create a mutable variable and understand why it is called that. Let's call it <code class="language-javascript">month</code> and put data into it using the <code class="language-javascript">=</code> symbol:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let month = "November"; // define the variable and assign it a value</code></pre><p>In variables, it is possible to store any type of data. In this case, you've saved the <code class="language-javascript">November</code> string. You can refer to this line if you use a variable name:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let month = "November";

console.log(month); // outputs the content of the variable to the console</code></pre><p>This code outputs the contents of the variable into the console. In our case, the result will be the string <code class="language-javascript">November</code> â€” check it yourself.</p><p></p><div class="alert alert-warning"><p>The case of a name is important: <code class="language-javascript">month</code> is not the same as <code class="language-javascript">Month</code>.</p></div><p></p><p>Now, let's try to change the variable and output a new value to the console:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let month = "November";
month = "December";

console.log(month); // December</code></pre><p>As you can see, the value of the variable has changed. Now, it stores the <code class="language-javascript">December</code> string.</p><h5 id="other-ways-to-declare-variables">Other ways to declare variables</h5><p>In older scripts, you may notice that the <code class="language-javascript">var</code> keyword is used instead of <code class="language-javascript">let</code>. This keyword served to declare variables before the introducing <code class="language-javascript">let</code> and <code class="language-javascript">const</code> in the ECMAScript 6 (ES6) standard. It looks like this:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">var age = 21;</code></pre><p>While variables declared with <code class="language-javascript">let</code> or <code class="language-javascript">const</code> are limited to the block in which they are defined, these variables are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are declared, even outside the block in which they are declared. This can lead to unintended variable pollution. Additionally, variables declared with <code class="language-javascript">var</code> having function-level scope can lead to variable hoisting and potential bugs or errors due to accidental redeclaration. For these reasons, it's generally recommended to use <code class="language-javascript">let</code> or <code class="language-javascript">const</code> instead of <code class="language-javascript">var</code> in modern JavaScript code, as they offer more predictable behavior.</p><p>You can also find code when variables are declared without keywords:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">age = 21;</code></pre><p>It's not good practice, either. In the future, we will consider why it is a bad idea to declare variables without keywords or with <code class="language-javascript">var</code>, but for now, getting acquainted with the constants is more practical.</p><h5 id="constants">Constants</h5><p>Declare the immutable variable called <code class="language-javascript">language</code> and add the <code class="language-javascript">JavaScript</code> string as a value:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const language = "JavaScript";
</code></pre><p>If we wanted to change the value of a variable created with the <code class="language-javascript">const</code> keyword, we would have failed and got an error:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const language = "JavaScript";
language = "PHP"; // error</code></pre><p>Now that you know about variables, you can create more complex and interesting programs.</p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>Variables are a fundamental concept in programming, allowing developers to store and manipulate data in an organized way. With variables, it is possible to create more complex and exciting programs. Remember to choose meaningful and readable names for your variables to make your code easy to understand.</p><p>Lastly, it is crucial to use the correct syntax to declare variables as mutable or immutable; each of these types has its peculiarities. You will be one step closer to becoming a proficient programmer by mastering variables.</p>
